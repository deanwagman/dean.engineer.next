Tesla Project highlights:

# Overview of My Work at Tesla

## 1. Scaling Applications with Internal Libraries and Reusable Components
At Tesla, one of my key contributions was scaling applications by developing internal libraries and reusable components, which improved code reusability by approximately 30%. I created a structured approach for identifying reusable components, documented them comprehensively, and integrated them across multiple projects. This effort significantly enhanced consistency and efficiency, allowing teams to focus on feature development rather than reinventing solutions.

## 2. Internationalization and Multi-Currency Support
I was part of the team focusing on internationalization for Tesla's applications, supporting more than 10 languages during new launches. This included displaying multiple currencies for different regions, crucial for rolling out Tesla vehicles in new international markets. My work involved ensuring that text strings were accurately translated, displaying legal and regulatory information, and expanding localization metrics, such as currencies and units. Additionally, I contributed to front-end support for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and (not released) Dogecoin, which required updating internal tools and libraries like TDS (Tesla Design System) to accommodate new languages and conventions. I coordinated with stakeholders globally to ensure accurate localization and currency conversions, resulting in an enhanced user experience for Tesla's international customers.

## 3. Development of a React Native iPad Application for Test Drive Scheduling
I developed a React Native iPad application to streamline vehicle test drive scheduling. This involved integrating backend services, ensuring data synchronization, and optimizing the app for a smooth and intuitive user interface. The application simplified the test drive process, making it easier for both sales associates and customers to schedule and manage test drives efficiently.

## 4. Leading the Styling of the Vehicle Ordering Experience for Mobile Applications
I led the styling of the vehicle ordering experience in Tesla's mobile applications, working with a team of junior engineers. I provided mentorship, conducted code reviews, and ensured adherence to best practices, significantly improving design consistency across platforms. This effort resulted in a more cohesive and user-friendly interface, contributing to a better overall customer experience.

## 5. Resolving Performance Issues to Improve App Speed by 20%
I took on performance optimization challenges, increasing app speed by 20% through research and iteration. I used profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and implemented several optimizations, including lazy loading and efficient data fetching. These improvements led to a smoother, more responsive application, enhancing the user experience.

# Current Projects and Continued Growth
Since leaving Tesla, I have continued to work on a diverse range of web and mobile projects, focusing on JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, and scalable UI architectures. These projects involve bridging design and development, creating consistent and high-quality user interfaces, and balancing visual quality with performance and scalability. I am committed to staying at the forefront of technology and constantly improving my skills to deliver impactful solutions.
